# Android Device: Motorola G62 5G - Codename: rhodec
I try to compile /e/os the hard way, because it gives no twrp.img or LineageOS.zip or eOS.zip for my device.

Please help me out if you can. Is my first time to compile self a OS for android.

My reference pages are:
[Device Tree Moto G52 - Lineage 22.2](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_device_motorola_rhode/tree/lineage-22.2)
